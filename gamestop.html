            You remember your brother mentioned a new game he really wanted, so you head to Game Stop. You see someone turned away who looks a lot like your brother, so you go over and drag him out of the store. It isn't until you leave the store that you realize that the person you were pulling out isn't actually your brother, but a fat old man with a beard. You quickly apoligize and run away.
