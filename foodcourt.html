    You decide that your brother isn't worth looking for and realize you haven't had anything to eat since the day before, so you head over to the food court to get something to eat. You get your food and start looking for a table. You see someone who looks a lot like your brother, so you start walking towards him. As you're approaching him, he looks up and looks terrified. Congrats, you've found your brother!
